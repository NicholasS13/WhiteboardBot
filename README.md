## To get this code to work you will need to make edits to your installs
You'll need to install a lower version of board manager esp32 by espressif. I installed version 2.0.17.

Also, you will need to install a lower version of the library ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon. I installed version 6.21.5.

Once you've done that, reinstall the Painless Mesh library to undo any changes you made to the source code.
